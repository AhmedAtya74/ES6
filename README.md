# JavaScript


### Hoisting of var

Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.<br>
This means that if we do this:
``` 
console.log (greeter);
var greeter = "say hello"
```

it is interpreted as this:
```
var greeter;
console.log(greeter); // greeter is undefined
greeter = "say hello"
```
